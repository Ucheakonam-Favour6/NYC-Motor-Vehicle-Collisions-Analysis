## Project Overview

This project analyzes New York City motor vehicle collision data to identify accident patterns, high-risk periods, locations, and contributing factors. Using Excel, the analysis uncovers trends in collision frequency, time-based risk, and factors associated with severe and fatal accidents, supporting data-driven road safety insights.

## Objectives

•	Analyze collision trends across months, days, and hours

•	Identify streets with the highest accident frequency

•	Examine common contributing factors to vehicle collisions

•	Highlight factors associated with fatal and severe accidents

## Key Metrics

•	Total Number of Collisions

•	Percentage of Total Accidents by Month

•	Accident Frequency by Day of the Week

•	Accident Frequency by Hour of Day

•	Top Streets with the Highest Number of Accidents

•	Most Common Contributing Factors (Vehicle 1)

•	Contributing Factors Resulting in Fatal Accidents

## Tools Used

•	Microsoft Excel

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated

•	Data cleaning and preprocessing

•	Date and time transformation (hour extraction)

•	Descriptive analysis and aggregation

•	Pivot tables and pivot charts

•	Trend analysis and pattern recognition

•	Dashboard design and layout

•	Data storytelling and insight generation

## Visualizations Included

•	Column Chart: Percentage of total accidents by month

•	Horizontal Bar Chart: Accident frequency by day of the week

•	Line Chart: Accident frequency by hour of day

•	Bar Chart: Streets with the most reported accidents

•	Bar Chart: Most common contributing factors (Vehicle 1)

•	Stacked Bar Chart: Contributing factors resulting in fatal accidents

•	Dashboard: Integrated view of accident trends and risk factors

## Key Insights

•	Collision rates peak in March, followed by a gradual decline for the remainder of the year.

•	Fridays record the highest number of accidents, indicating increased end-of-week traffic risk.

•	Accident frequency peaks between 2:00 PM and 6:00 PM, aligning with evening rush-hour traffic.

•	Belt Parkway records the highest number of collisions, identifying it as a major traffic safety hotspot.

•	Unspecified factors account for the majority of contributing factors for Vehicle 1, highlighting data quality limitations.

•	Unsafe speed and driver inattention/distraction are strongly associated with fatal accidents.

## Recommendations

•	Increase traffic monitoring and enforcement during peak afternoon hours and on Fridays.

•	Implement targeted safety interventions on high-risk roads such as Belt Parkway.

•	Promote driver awareness campaigns focused on speed management and distraction reduction.

•	Improve collision reporting practices to reduce the number of unspecified contributing factors.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Excel to analyze large public safety datasets, identify risk patterns, and communicate insights through an interactive dashboard. The analysis provides actionable recommendations that could support traffic safety planning and policy decisions.
